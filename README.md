# workDayScheduler-HW5

This is a basic application that presents users with color coded time blocks to enter reminders saved to local storage.

- When a user opens this web app, the current date is presented to them
- Rows represending time blocks of the typical work day can take user input
- That user input can be saved and persists in local storage
- Color coding indicates current time (grey), hours passed (red), and future time (green)
